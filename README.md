The repository for my mobile rune reading game
I will be the only person working on this game. It will feature an opening screen with an image of Odin, raven on his shoulder, 
shrouded in a cloak within a foggy forest, with the name of the game. Then it will feature a flat surface, wooden design like a table, 
with poetic instructions to introduce the user to the game and instruct them to shake their phone to "cast the runes".
A set of 24 stones will roll across the screen. Each stone has a Rune on one side, blank on all others. 

Any rune that falls face up in the view of the screen will be a part of the fortune. Since there are 24 stones, and the mobile phone 
screen isn't large, many of the stones will roll out of view. 

Once the stones stop rolling, a button will appear that says "Receive Odin's Word." Until the user pushes that button, 
the stones remain as they are. 
When the user pushes the button, then the stones disappear and a unique fortune, based on the runes that were face up, will appear in text.

By allowing stones to roll out of view, I limit the number of runes, thus making the fortune telling more manageable.

For assignments 10&11, I've linked Unity and GitHub, I'm the only one on the project and I can use both tools just fine. I used the GitHub
for Unity asset to do this.
