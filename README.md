A divination mobile app based on Viking Runes

The repository for my mobile rune reading game
I was the only person who worked on this game. 

The goal of the game was to create a divination session similar to what what happen if you'd lived in the Viking age and visited a priest/priestess for a reading. A tab with poetic instructions to introduce the user to the game overlays a wooden table instructs the user  to shake their phone to "cast the runes".

There are 24 runes plus one blank stone, called Odin's Stone. When the user shakes their phone, my game randomly selects six of them, creates six runes with the images on them, and "tosses" them on the table.

Once the stones stop rolling, a button appears that says "Read the Runes." Until the user pushes that button, 
the stones remain as they are. When the user pushes the button, a window pops up with a unique fortune, based on the runes that were face up.

There is a "Try Again" option so that the user can play as many times as they wish. In addition, the Twitter button will allow the user to share the game with it's Google Play store location on their Twitter feed.

Assets for this project: A package of wooden plank surfaces for the table top. A pack of rune art that I used as the images on the cylinder pre-fabs I have for each rune. The sound of large stones hitting a hard surface. In order to make it more professional, I also got an asset pack for all the popups and buttons that I use. Lastly, I imported a lovely Norse song to play on a loop.

Resources: The book was my main resource, but I relied a lot on the Unity support pages as well as their API. Such amazingly clear documentation. I found code samples for making my lights flicker there and settled in on a final solution. I watched a lot of fantastic videos by YouTuber, Brackeys. My son is also making a game in Unity right now, and he turned me on to this guy. I used his videos to learn how to fade between scenes, to work with collision physics and post the game to Twitter. I also found that many other developers had similiar issues as I, and followed various Unity discussions. For example, in order to share my project with prospective employers, I loaded my game on Google Play and then it was quickly removed due to the fact that I didn't have a privacy agreement. Since my app doesn't have ads, nor do I collect any user data, I didn't think I needed one. I went to the Unity forum and found that Unity itself collects the Andriod Ad ID, even if you don't have ads turned on. There was a scripting workaround, but that meant I had to rebuild and encrypt my app to launch it again. Rather than do that, I left it open, just in case I want to turn on Unity ads in the future, and created a privacy agreement on my website. 

I learned a lot from this project for sure.
